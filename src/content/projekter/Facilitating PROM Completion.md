title: "AI-Driven Virtual Assistant for Stroke Patient for Facilitating PROM Completion through Conversational Agent Strategies"
description: "This project explores the use of Conversational Agents (CAs) to improve the completion of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for stroke survivors. We developed a framework based on prior research to guide the design of CA interactions and conducted a design evaluation with stroke survivors to refine the interface and Likert scale selectors."

        <p>This project explores the use of Conversational Agents (CAs) to improve the completion of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for stroke survivors. We developed a framework based on prior research to guide the design of CA interactions and conducted a design evaluation with stroke survivors to refine the interface and Likert scale selectors.</p>
        <h4>Key Aspects:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Framework Development:</strong> Identified effective conversational strategies for PROM administration.</li>
            <li><strong>Design Evaluation:</strong> Tested various interface designs and conducted a workshop with stroke survivors. <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/2xl02dXnuIz7IlEJ000uv6/Med10?link=homepage&pscd=psxid.figma.com&ps_partner_key=c292cm5jb21tZXJjZWRlbWFuZHRlYW01Mjc4&sid=lo43f5cyug0002cl0sdqy&node-id=56-151&starting-point-node-id=3%3A35&ps_xid=9VGAIQGystVh4Y&gsxid=9VGAIQGystVh4Y&gspk=c292cm5jb21tZXJjZWRlbWFuZHRlYW01Mjc4" target="_blank">Figma link to the different UI designs.</a></li>
            <li><strong>Experimental Comparison:</strong> Compared reflective questions and examples to reduce satisficing behavior during the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) completion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Findings:</h4>
        <p>Participants preferred the CAâ€™s engaging conversational approach over traditional methods but faced challenges with the interface and conversational strategies, highlighting the need for improved onboarding.</p>
        <p>This study demonstrates the potential of CAs to enhance PROM collection through interactive and user-friendly design.</p>
