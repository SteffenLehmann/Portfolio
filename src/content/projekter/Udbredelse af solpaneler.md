        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>This project focused on designing a mobile app that eliminates text to promote the adoption of solar panels among indigenous communities in Namibia. The primary goal was to develop an intuitive, icon-based interface that guides users in both using and maintaining solar panels without relying on written instructions. By replacing text with visual cues, the app aimed to simplify the learning process and make it more accessible. Clear, visual guidelines were essential to effectively support the adoption of sustainable technology in these communities.</p>

        <h4>Context & Assumptions</h4>
        <p>The app was designed for smartphone users, assuming basic familiarity with mobile technology. The design focused on small, portable solar panels with an emphasis on ease of use. Additionally, no body interaction or advanced gestures were required to ensure simplicity and accessibility.</p>

        <h4>Design Approach</h4>
        <p><b>Research and Inspirations: </b>Icons were inspired by user-centered design principles to enhance usability and comprehension. The appâ€™s map interface was influenced by participatory design projects and aimed to be intuitive and engaging. Metaphorical design elements were incorporated to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and user understanding.</p>
        <p><b>Prototype Features: </b>The prototype features a visually-driven home screen displaying app features using icons and imagery. Interactive icons symbolize actions like charging or maintenance, using familiar metaphors and idioms. Visual indicators, such as color-coded bars and symbolic icons (e.g., check marks, X symbols), convey correct and incorrect actions without text.</p>
        <p><b>Visual Cues and Indicators: </b>The app provides visual indicators for charging solar panels, differentiating between day and night, battery levels, and correct or incorrect usage. Color coding (green for correct, red for incorrect) communicates status and enhances understanding without text.</p>
