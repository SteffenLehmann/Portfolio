    <p>This project aimed to enhance the care provided to stroke patients by leveraging AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop a prototype virtual assistant (VA). The assistant was designed to guide healthcare professionals through complex data registries and improve their ability to analyze and visualize key quality indicators (QIs) such as mortality rates, door-to-needle time (DNT), and stroke type.</p>
    <h4>Using AI and NLP in UX Research</h4>
    <p>We conducted UX research to understand the needs and behaviors of neurologists, particularly how they interact with data and what they require from a virtual assistant. The VA prototype was built using AI and NLP techniques to create a dynamic, interactive interface that could communicate with users via text, multiple choice, and voice.</p>
    <p>The VA was designed to be both active and bi-directional, adapting its responses based on user input to provide a more collaborative experience. This included suggesting analyses, comparing QIs with other hospitals, and visualizing data trends. The goal was to create an interface that was not only informative but also intuitive and engaging, helping users to identify areas for improvement and facilitating discussions with peers and administrators.</p>
    <h4>Interface and Interaction Design</h4>
    <p>The design process involved iterative testing with teams of neurologists who regularly use data registries like RES-Q. Through semi-structured online interviews and scenario-based evaluations, we identified key design considerations such as the need for a balance between active guidance and user control, and the importance of clear signifiers to support user interactions.</p>
    <h4>Findings and Future Directions</h4>
    <p>Our findings revealed that while participants trusted the data provided by the VA, they required transparent explanations and visual support to validate the assistant's recommendations. Neurologists also expressed a preference for influencing the VA's behavior, suggesting a need for more intuitive interaction mechanisms such as dynamic buttons and embedded control schemes.</p>
    <p>The use of AI and NLP allowed us to create a VA that not only automates repetitive tasks but also offers advanced analysis suggestions tailored to the user's context. Moving forward, the design recommendations include enhancing the VA's memory to support more personalized and efficient interactions, and further exploring how such tools can democratize access to data-driven insights in healthcare settings.</p>
